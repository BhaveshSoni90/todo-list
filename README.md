# To-Do List Application

## Overview

This is a simple To-Do List application developed as part of an internship project. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. The tasks can be categorized, have due dates, and are assigned priority levels. The application uses local storage to persist data across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter a new task with a category, due date, and priority.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks, including their description, category, due date, and priority.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Check off tasks to mark them as completed.
- **Persist Data:** Tasks are saved in local storage and remain across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
